# https://osv.dev/vulnerability/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
# Patches
#  No patch is yet available, however work is underway to migrate to a fully constant-time implementation.
# Workarounds
#  The only currently available workaround is to avoid using the rsa crate in settings where attackers are 
#  able to observe timing information, e.g. local use on a non-compromised computer is fine.
